## Simple time tracker (Todo app name ðŸ˜‰)
Does 1 thing and does it well. Helps you to track your time you spent on projects. Currently in alpha.

While building this project I aim to maintain as much of accessebility as I can. The project can be navigated with keyboard only. Also, all dialogs has its own routes so you can safely reload your page or open it in a new tab and you will not lose your dialogs ðŸ˜Ž

Now this project doesn't have any server so it simply saves data to browser's local storage (temprary, and the code may not be optimized in repositories)

## Getting started

1. Clone the repository
2. Install packages with `yarn` command

Congragulations! Now you can

- Check storybook components with `yarn storybook` command
- Launch project  with `yarn start` command
- Launch tests with `yarn test` command
- Build for production with `yarn build` command

## Technologies/Libraries used in the project

- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - amazing Javascript library for building user interfaces
- [Reach Router](https://reach.tech/router) - Router for React built with accessibility in mind
- [JSS](https://cssinjs.org/) - CSS in JS Library
- [Typescript](http://www.typescriptlang.org/) - Typed superset of Javasript
- [Storybook](https://storybook.js.org/) - development environment for UI components
- [Jest](https://jestjs.io/) - Javascript testing framework
- [React Testing Library](https://testing-library.com/docs/react-testing-library/intro) - simple and complete React DOM testing utilities that encourage good testing practices
- [TSLint](https://palantir.github.io/tslint/) - Typescript linter (should change to typescript-eslint)

## Project navigator

- `components` - React components
- `extensions` - extension methods for built-in types
- `hooks` - reusable React hooks
- `repositories` - repositories with data for the app
- `stories` - stories for storybook
- `typings` - d.ts modules for typing app
- `utils` - utility functions

The `components` folder divided by business logic. The Exception is pages folder. It contains components used in page navigation. This way I can quickly see what pages exist in the project and also I can quickly switch to other router-library if needed
