# Terminology

## Timestamp
  Timestamp basically is an action which user executes on some task. For example if I worked on Task X, I pushed the button to start task X, and a timestamp is created for this task. I can add comment for timestamp and later change start and end datetimes.

## Task
  Task is an entity that can contain timestamps. Usually when you're working on a project the work is divided on tasks.

## Project
  Project is an entity which contains tasks and subprojects. For example if you work on website X you can make a project with name "Website X",
  and if you work on Website Y at the same time, you can make a project with name "Website Y" and divide tasks on these projects.
